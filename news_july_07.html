								<h3>FLICKERAMA - LABYRINTH MASQUERADE BALL</h3>
								<h4>15th September 2017 - 730pm - midnight</h4>
								<b>Labyrinth Masquerade Ball (U)</b><br>
								<p>Join us for a night of mystery and wonder as Flickerama hosts a very special Masquerade Ball alongside a screening of Jim Henson’s 1986 cult favourite Labyrinth. The screening takes place in Flickerama’s beautiful indoor pavilions and will be followed by a masquerade ball with based on the eccentric party Sarah and the Goblin King attend in the film.  Look into the crystal ball of the UK’s leading contact juggler who will enchant you with his incredible close-up magic. So don your finest evening wear, select a specially themed cocktail and enter a world of fantasy. </p><br>
								<h3>FLICKERAMA - CULT AND COMIC DAY</h3>
								<h4>16th September 2017 - 1230pm - midnight </h4>
								<b>Harry Potter & The Philosopher’s Stone (PG)</b><br>
								<p>It’s been twenty years since the very first Harry Potter book was published, so the main event in our outdoor arena could only ever be one film – the very first Harry Potter movie, the beginning of a global franchise that taught millions of people what a Muggle is. This really is a magical movie in both content and style, and our outdoor arena will host a special after party in our wizard themed bar serving ale, movie cocktails and of course Butterbeer.</p><br>
								<b>The Room (18)</b><br>
								<p>Made in 2003, The Room is a truly bizarre, genuinely hilarious relationship drama that has slowly and steadily become a bona fide cult classic thanks to a legion of fans who have come to love its bizarre plot, terrible acting and strange editing. Over the years, audience interaction has become a big part of The Room's eccentric appeal, as audience members don tuxedos, shout out lines and throw plastic spoons at the screen, all thoroughly encouraged for this special Flickerama screening. The Room is the Citizen Kane of bad movies, and just as memorable.</p><br>
								<b>Deadpool (15)</b><br>
								<p>The superhero genre got a much needed kick in the behind with this anarchic comic book movie, a beautifully sarcastic riposte to all the clichés and conventions that years of Marvel and DC movies have created.</p><br>
								<b>Edward Scissorhands (PG)</b><br>
								<p>1990 fantasy Edward Scissorhands was the first of Johnny Depp’s many collaborations with director Tim Burton, and it’s no stretch to suggest it remains their best. Depp is perfect as the title character of this wintry fairytale, with Burton’s idol Vincent Price appearing briefly as Edward Scissorhand’s creator, who dies and leaves Edward alone in their hilltop castle. When an Avon lady comes by (Dianne Wiest), she takes Edward to her bright suburban home, where he rattles the local community and falls in love with the angelic Kim (Winona Ryder).<br>
								A brilliant juxtaposition of Gothic visuals and the type of sunny Californian suburb Burton himself grew up in, Edward Scissorhands could well earn the accolade of Burton’s masterpiece. It’s emotional, unique and utterly absorbing, and it began Depp’s journey to oddball leading man.
								</p><br>
								<b>Ghostbusters (12A)</b><br>
								<p>Who ya gonna call? Egon, Peter, Winston and Ray, that’s who. Ivan Reitman’s 1980s blockbuster comedy is a spooky favourite which has never lost its universal appeal, sure to keep both kids and adults happy on our main outdoor stage. Ghostbusters begins with three university parapsychologists losing their research grant and deciding to go into business for themselves, recruiting a fourth member and setting up as professional paranormal eliminators named the Ghostbusters. Starting out with only a converted fire station and a beat-up ambulance to their name, the Ghostbusters quickly become local heroes when the city sees a dramatic rise in supernatural activity.<br>
								With Bill Murray starring opposite a host of New York's undead and an infinitely quotable script from Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, Ghostbusters is one of the most entertaining movies to ever come out of Hollywood. No argument.</p><br>
								<b>60s Batman movie (Adam West tribute) (U)</b><br>
								<p>Holy Adam West tribute! This year saw the passing of the great Adam West, the man who for many people is still the quintessential Batman. So it seems only right that our cult screen should pay tribute to the man by showing the feature length version of the 1960s Batman TV series which made West into a household name.</p><br>
								<b>Amaryllis (15)</b><br>
								<p>A special preview screening of this ground-breaking and innovative feature-length modern day silent film a specially recorded electronic score. Set on location in Birmingham, Cornwall and the Cotswolds, Amaryllis is the story of a talented teenage skater girl who, in a bid to escape her overbearing alcoholic mother, reaches out to a charismatic drug dealer but his affection isn’t all it seems. The film stars rising British talent Ella McLoughlin and acclaimed actor Adam El Hagar (Peaky Blinders, Tyrant) alongside a host of established UK artists including British soul-singer Omar, Liz May Brice (Black Mirror) and Tanya Myers (Silent Witness, Control).</p><br>
								<b>Guardians Of The Galaxy (12A)</b><br>
								<p>Marvel's greatest risk could well be their greatest success. Who would have thought a ragtag bunch of outsiders, including a talking raccoon and a tree who can only say one sentence, would turn out to be as loved a comic book team as The Avengers? An action-packed space adventure, Guardians of the Galaxy expands the Marvel Cinematic Universe into the cosmos, where brash adventurer Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) finds himself the object of an unrelenting bounty hunt after stealing a mysterious orb coveted by Ronan (Lee Pace), a powerful villain with ambitions that threaten the entire universe. To evade the ever-persistent Ronan, Quill is forced into an uneasy truce with a collection of disparate misfits – Rocket, a gun toting raccoon, Groot, a tree-like humanoid, the deadly Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and the revenge driven Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista). But when Peter discovers the true power of the orb, he must do his best to rally his ragtag rivals for a last, desperate stand.</p><br>
								<b>Adult cosplay competition</b><br>
								<p>The best dressed adult will win their very own private screening at Birmingham’s Electric Cinema for them and up to 70 of their friends!</p><br>
								<h3>FLICKERAMA - FAMILY FUN DAY</h3>
								<h4>17th September 2017 - 1230pm - midnight</h4>
								<b>Labyrinth (U)</b><br>
								<p>A family screening of Jim Henson’s 1986 cult favourite Labyrinth.  Frustrated with babysitting on yet another weekend evening, Sarah (Jennifer Connelly), a teenager with an active imagination, inadvertently summons goblins to take her baby stepbrother away. When little Toby actually disappears, Sarah must follow him into a fantastical world to rescue him from the Goblin King (David Bowie). Guarding his castle is the labyrinth itself, a twisted maze of deception, populated with outrageous characters and unknown dangers. Sarah must get through it in time to save Toby, or the Goblin King will keep him there forever… Featuring a whole host of Henson puppets both loveable and enjoyably creepy, Labyrinth holds a special place in the hearts of millions of people, and this very special evening will celebrate one of the finest fantasy films to ever come out of Hollywood.<br>
								 The screening takes place in Flickerama’s Classics Screen and will be followed by a masquerade ball based on the eccentric party Sarah and the Goblin King attend in the film, complete with themed cocktails. So don your finest evening wear, raise a Venetian mask and enter a world of fantasy...</p><br>
								<b>Frozen Singalong (PG)</b><br>
								<p>Get those pipes working as we host a huge Frozen Singalong on our main stage. Sing along to an award winning score in an environment perfect for singing out loud and proud, with maybe even a graceful dance move or two thrown in for good measure.  Frozen is a stunning big screen comedy adventure that’s swiftly become one of the most popular Disney films ever made.<br>
								Fearless optimist Anna (voice of Kristen Bell) sets off on an epic journey – teaming up with rugged mountain man Kristoff (voice of Jonathan Groff) and his loyal reindeer Sven – to find her sister Elsa (voice of Idina Menzel), whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom of Arendelle in eternal winter. Encountering Everest-like conditions, mystical trolls and a hilarious snowman named Olaf, Anna and Kristoff battle the elements in a race to save the kingdom.</p><br>
								<b>Matilda (PG)</b><br>
								<p>Roald Dahl stories have had a particularly impressive track record when it comes to big screen adaptations, and Danny DeVito’s take on Matilda ranks up there with the best of them, a family movie that’s both clever and heartwarming. Mara Wilson stars as Matilda, a super-smart little girl who’s woefully misunderstood by her parents (DeVito and Rhea Perlman), her brother and an evil school principal. But with the help of a brave best friend and a wonderful teacher, Matilda discovers she doesn’t have to get mad to get even – she can tap into some very special powers…<br>
								Pam Ferris delivers a performance for the ages as loopy headmistress Mrs Trunchbull, prone to swinging schoolgirls around by their pigtails, whilst Wilson makes the perfect plucky heroine for little girls everywhere.</p><br>
								<b>Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory (U)</b><br>
								<p>We continue our celebration of Roald Dahl on film with perhaps his best known story – Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, adapted for the screen in 1971 and giving Gene Wilder the role he was born to play. Young Charlie Bucket (Peter Ostrum) wins one of the coveted 'Golden Tickets' from a Wonka Bar that allows its holder to take a trip around the chocolate factory of the eccentric Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder). Upon arrival, Charlie and the rest of the winners find themselves in a magical world of chocolate rivers, Oompa Loompas, everlasting gobstoppers, lickable wall-paper, golden egg-laying geese and chilling tales to warn children not to misbehave.<br>
								Packed full of memorable songs and mouth watering confectionary, it’s not hard to see why – well over forty years later – this candy coloured classic is still enthralling new generations.</p><br>
								<b>Big (12A)</b><br>
								<p>Tom Hanks might be better known these days for powerhouse, Oscar winning performances, but he’s got a knack for laughs too, one which shines bright in this 1988 body swap comedy. After a fairground wish turns 12-year-old Josh Baskin (David Moscow) into a 30-year-old man (Hanks), he heads to New York City and gets a low-level job at MacMillen Toy Company. A chance encounter with the owner (Robert Loggia) of the company leads to a promotion testing new toys, whilst a fellow employee (Elizabeth Perkins) takes a romantic interest in Josh. However, the pressure of living as an adult begins to overwhelm him, and soon he longs to return to his simple former life as a young boy.</p><br>
								<b>The Goonies (12A)</b><br>
								<p>Booby traps, pirate ships and buried treasure are the order of the day in The Goonies, a cult favourite that teaches life lessons without being preachy and offers up the kind of swashbuckling action that will keep both kids and adults enthralled.</p><br>
								<b>Kids cosplay competition</b><br>
								<p>Let your little ones imaginations run wild at our special Kids Cosplay Competition. Win a free private screening at The Electric Cinema in Birmingham for your kids and up to 70 of their friends!</p><br>
								<b>Safety Last! (U)</b><br>
								<p>Experience the comic genius of silent movie star Harold Lloyd just as audiences would have 90 years ago with live piano accompaniment! Standing alongside Keaton and Chaplin as one of cinema’s finest physical comedians, his crowning glory is undoubtedly his 1923 film Safety Last!, featuring the infamous stunt where Lloyd ends up hanging from a gigantic clock face.</p><br>
								<b>The Lego Batman Movie (U)</b><br>
								<p>Jokes come at you quicker than the Batmobile in this genius self-aware comedy, one which turns familiar Batman characters completely on their heads, not least the Caped Crusader himself. Undoubtedly the best Batman film in years.</p><br>
