								<div class="image main"><img src="images/film2.jpg" alt="" /></div>
								<p><h3>The Arena Screen (outdoor)</h3>
								<b>Harry Potter & The Philosopher’s Stone</b><br>
								It’s been twenty years since the very first Harry Potter book was published, so the main event in our outdoor arena could only ever be one film – the very first Harry Potter movie, the beginning of a global franchise that taught millions of people what a Muggle is. This really is a magical movie in both content and style, and our outdoor arena will host a special after party in our wizard themed bar serving ale, movie cocktails and of course Butterbeer.<br>
								<b>The Goonies (12A)</b><br>
								Booby traps, pirate ships and buried treasure are the order of the day in The Goonies, a cult favourite that teaches life lessons without being preachy and offers up the kind of swashbuckling action that will keep both kids and adults enthralled.<br>
								<b>Kids cosplay competition</b><br>
								Let your little ones imaginations run wild at our special Kids Cosplay Competition. Win a free private screening at The Electric Cinema in Birmingham for your kids and up to 70 of their friends!<br>
								<b>Frozen Singalong (U)</b><br>
								Get those pipes working as we host a huge Frozen Singalong on our main stage. Sing along to an award winning score in an environment perfect for singing out loud and proud, with maybe even a graceful dance move or two thrown in for good measure.<br>
								<b>Safety Last! (U)</b><br>
								Experience the comic genius of silent movie star Harold Lloyd just as audiences would have 90 years ago with live piano accompaniment! Standing alongside Keaton and Chaplin as one of cinema’s finest physical comedians, his crowning glory is undoubtedly his 1923 film Safety Last!, featuring the infamous stunt where Lloyd ends up hanging from a gigantic clock face.</p>
								<p><h3>The Classics screen</h3>								<b>Labyrinth Masquerade Ball (U)</b><br>
								Join us for a night of mystery and wonder as Flickerama hosts a very special Masquerade Ball alongside a screening of Jim Henson’s 1986 cult favourite Labyrinth. The screening takes place in one of Flickerama’s indoor pavilions and will be followed by a masquerade ball based on the eccentric party Sarah and the Goblin King attend in the film, complete with themed cocktails and a sumptuous meal. So don your finest evening wear, raise a Venetian mask and enter a world of fantasy. As this event will be oversubscribed, entrance to the screening can only be guaranteed by purchasing a special Labyrinth Party ticket.<br>
								<b>Dirty Dancing (12A)</b><br>
								One of those special films which has slowly built a formidable legacy ever since its original release, Dirty Dancing has become a touchstone for an entire generation and is still weaving its hip-wiggling spell on younger audiences.<br>
								<b>Breakfast At Tiffany’s cocktail party (PG)</b><br>
								Sophistication. Laughs. Romance. A cat. Breakfast At Tiffany’s has got it all, telling the warm-hearted story of two bohemians falling in love against a Manhattan backdrop. This indoor screening will be accompanied by the kind of classy cocktail party Holly Golightly herself would enjoy, forming the perfect backdrop for a true Hollywood classic, one which turned Audrey Hepburn into an international icon.</p>
								<p><h3>The Cult Screen</h3>
								<b>Deadpool (15)</b><br>
								The superhero genre got a much needed kick in the behind with this anarchic comic book movie, a beautifully sarcastic riposte to all the clichés and conventions that years of Marvel and DC movies have created.<br>
								<b>Adult cosplay competition</b><br>
								Best dressed adult will win their very own private screening at Birmingham’s Electric Cinema for them and up to 70 of their friends!<br>
								<b>The Room (18)</b><br>
								Made in 2003, The Room is a truly bizarre, genuinely hilarious relationship drama that has slowly and steadily become a bona fide cult classic thanks to a legion of fans who have come to love its bizarre plot, terrible acting and strange editing. Over the years, audience interaction has become a big part of The Room's eccentric appeal, as audience members don tuxedos, shout out lines and throw plastic spoons at the screen, all thoroughly encouraged for this late night Flickerama screening. The Room is the Citizen Kane of bad movies, and just as memorable.<br>
								<b>60s Batman movie (Adam West tribute) (U)</b><br>
								Holy Adam West tribute! This year saw the passing of the great Adam West, the man who for many people is still the quintessential Batman. So it seems only right that our cult screen should pay tribute to the man by showing the feature length version of the 1960s Batman TV series which made West into a household name.<br>
								<b>The Lego Batman Movie (U)</b><br>
								Jokes come at you quicker than the Batmobile in this genius self-aware comedy, one which turns familiar Batman characters completely on their heads, not least the Caped Crusader himself. Undoubtedly the best Batman film in years.</p>
